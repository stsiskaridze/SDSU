    "\n",
    "- **Running time** function $T(n)$ usually is defined only on **integer input sizes**.\n",

    "\n",

    "- Let's go back to our **sorting problem**:\n",
    "  - **Input**: A sequence of $n$ numbers $\\left \\langle a_1, a_2, \\cdots, a_n \\right \\rangle$\n",
    "  - **Output**: A permutation (reordering) $\\left \\langle a_1, a_2, \\cdots, a_n \\right \\rangle$ of the input sequence such that $a'_1 \\leq a'_2 \\leq \\cdots \\leq a'_n$\n",
    "\n",

    "  where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants. W\n",

    "  \n",
    "- We said that **running time** of this algorithm is $\\Theta(n^2)$, but what this notation really means? \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- Did you ask yourself a questions like:\n",
    "  - if the running time of the algorithm takes not more than $a n^2$ steps than can you write also that $T(n) = \\Theta(n^3)$?\n",
    "  - if the running time of the algorithm is $\\Theta(n^2)$ why it can not be $\\Theta(n)$?\n",
